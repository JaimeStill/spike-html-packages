## Tasks

1. [ ] layers
2. [ ] layout
3. [ ] hosting
4. [ ] registries
5. [ ] consumers
6. [ ] answer

## Decisions

- setup: the evidence is the eight items in `context/README.md`, "The evidence".
- setup: the spike packages copies with provenance: spike-html-conventions' layers (main a88828a)
  and spike-html-design v0.7.0's tools and modules; not fresh minimal fixtures, which would miss
  the `.css` beside the `.js` and the components-on-foundation dependency. Lit 3.3.3 is the runtime
  dependency.
- setup: v0.7.0's tools are split into three self-layered sheets (utilities: scroll and tables;
  structure: field stacks; meta: buttons and hue variants), not copied as one tools sheet.
- setup: v0.7.0's registry and keys family (grammar, runtime, help) are copied; preferences,
  theme-menu, register, and conformance stay out, since theme-menu and conformance write CSS from
  strings against the convention.
- setup: default profiles only (Flexoki, regular, mono); spike-html-design already proved
  profiles as extension packages.
- setup: registry trials publish for real to GitHub Packages and JSR, `@jaimestill` at 0.0.x; a
  JSR version can never be removed (a one-way door). How JSR is published (workstation or Actions
  OIDC) waits on the registries task's plan.
- setup: GitHub Packages uses gh's token, granted read:packages and write:packages by a one-time
  `gh auth refresh`, passed by environment variable and never written to a file.
- setup: consumers install under npm, pnpm, and bun; bun 1.4.3 is pinned as a consumer only.
- setup: kind code; `mise run check` = shellcheck, grown by the layers task to
  spike-html-conventions' check. `mise run currency` over conventions' pins. No gate, no
  `[remote] ci`. Public repository, since jsDelivr /gh/ serves public repositories only.
- setup: releases are 0.y.z annotated tags pushed as evidence and never changed; their form is
  the tag-naming evidence's. The layers task pushes no tag.
- setup: hosting splits into `hosting` (git tag, tarball, import map, tag naming) and
  `registries` (GitHub Packages, JSR), keeping the registries' one-way door apart.
- setup: references are keys in the coordinator's catalog: spike-html-design (v0.7.0) and
  spike-html-conventions (main a88828a), read-only; herald is spike-html-apps' concern. The spike
  keeps no references files.
- setup: the release tool and the lint choice wait on the layout task's evidence.
